## :eyeglasses: Repository Introduction
**Softuni projects** is a repository with tasks from **C# WEB Developer** courses I have attended at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/ "SoftUni").
Each course use to have its own repository, but in order to be more easy to navigate they were merged into one repository.
