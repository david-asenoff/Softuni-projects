## :eyeglasses: Repository Introduction
**Softuni projects** is a repository with tasks from **C# WEB Developer** courses I have attended at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/ "SoftUni").
Each course use to have its own repository, but in order to be more easy to navigate they were merged into one repository.
## :pencil2: About
1. Programming Basics - It provides the initial programming skills. This includes writing   basic code skills, working with  development environment  (IDE), using  variables  and data,  operators  and  expressions , working with the  console  (reading input data and printing results), using conditional constructions ( if ,  if - else) and cycles ( for ,  while ,  do - while).

2. Technology Fundamentals - This module examines fundamental programming concepts.  The main subjects to study are arrays, objects, lasses, HTML & CSS,  bitwise operations, basics of web development. Also some of the most common technologies and tools, are being explored, with which the module successfully builds students' knowledge of the upcoming professional modules and the knowledge they will acquire from them to become successful software developers.

3. C# Advanced - The course "C # Advanced" looks at the .NET platform as well as working with the C # language. The course teaches to create linear data structures, solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with constructions, files and directories, create class templates. Particular attention is paid to the functional programming paradigm as well as to the main data processing tool LINQ for data processing. The development environment is Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.

4. OOP - Includes the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (PLO), working with classes and objects, using object-oriented modeling and building class hierarchies. The basic principles of CMO are studied as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. It goes into the most commonly used design patterns. Draws attention to component testing (unit test writing) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD), the use of reflection, and the use of events.

5. Algorithms - The basic algorithms used in practice: recursion and recursive algorithms, search backtracking, combinatorial algorithms, sorting and searching algorithms. The course provides the skills to apply dynamic programming techniques to dealing with common practical tasks. The course looks at what a graph is, as well as various algorithms on columns and trees to crawl in depth and width.

6. Database Basics - Relational model, data modeling with ER diagrams (tables and relational links), working with the SQL language (data extraction, selection, projection, connections, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion and insertion).

7. C# WEB Basics - Lays the foundations of important principles laid down in ASP.NET Core . Introduce the basic principles of web development, such as HTTP protocol , cookies and sessions. 

8. Front End - The "Front-End" module provides basic knowledge of web technologies HTML and CSS. Acquire skills for proper structuring of the Front-End part of web applications and ways to style it according to a given design. In its second part, the module will introduce you to one of the most popular technological frameworks today - Angular. Attention will also be paid to the architecture and structuring of Single Page Applications and data retrieval from the REST service through queries.

9. JS Advanced - Working with linear structures  and associative arrays. Retrieving information from the DOM tree.  Word processing.  Working with features and JSON formats.

10. JS Application - What is HTTP and how to make requests, working with non-relational databases, create simple Single Page applications, work with REST API and asynchronous programming, working with templates and routing and code testing.

11. ReactJS - This is one of the Softuni's Front-End cources. It provides knowledge and practical skills for building client applications (Single Page Applications). The main subjects are: 'Working with templates and routing', ' Basic knowledge of React and JSX',  'Work with remote REST services',  'What is a Single Page Applicaion',  'Client applications with React' and  'Component-based applications'.
